          <h3>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING POLICY</h3>
          <p>
            Money laundering is the illegal process of concealing the origins of money obtained illegally by passing it
            through a complex sequence of banking transfers or commercial transactions. The overall scheme of this
            process returns the "clean" money to the launderer in an obscure and indirect way. Money laundering is most
            commonly associated with tax avoidance. However, other individuals may attempt to launder money in order to
            conceal their identity or finance their operations. ‘Suspicious activity’ is a very difficult concept to
            define because it can vary from one transaction to another based upon all the circumstances surrounding the
            transaction or group of transactions.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            At AlajeHub, we are committed to fighting money laundering and complying fully with anti-money laundering
            laws in Nigeria. Alaje Hub will take all reasonable and appropriate steps to prevent persons engaged in
            money laundering, fraud, or other financial crimes from utilizing our products and services. Our AML
            policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to ensure compliance with all applicable BSA
            regulations and FINRA rules and will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis to ensure appropriate
            policies, procedures and internal controls are in place to account for both changes in regulations and
            changes in our business. Key components of our AML and CTF framework include;

                account to be used and in some cases, the customer’s country of residence. In certain circumstances,
                Alaje Hub may perform enhanced due diligence procedures for customers presenting a higher risk, such as
                those transacting large volumes etc.
